<% title "Mark Hughes Good Sports Award" %>

<h1><%= yield(:title) %></h1>

<p>Named for SYG legend Mark Hughes, who was one of the first visionaries of SYG. These visionaries thought it would be great to run a sports weekend where churches could compete against each other, and at the same time outreach to young people to share about Jesus. Churches could use it as a way of encouraging non-Christian people to attend and hear about Jesus at the same time. </p>
<p>Mark died of cancer in 2011, but his legacy lives on today.</p> 
<p>The Mark Hughes award is given to an individual who demonstrates the SYG values of fairness, inclusion, welcome and Gospel-centred love for all as demonstrated through action.</p>
