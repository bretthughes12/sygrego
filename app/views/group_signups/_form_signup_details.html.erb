				<strong>Theme Brief</strong>
			</td>
			<td> 
				Gather, Grow, Go - have you been given the theme brief, do you have an understanding of the resources available?
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> 
				<strong>Volunteers</strong>
			</td>
			<td> 
				SYG runs on volunteers. Unless you are a first time group, make sure you are aware that your group is required to supply 1 volunteer for each 5 registrations. SYG requires volunteers for the running of the event, etc - marshals, sport coordinators, ushers...
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> 
				<strong>Insurance cover</strong>
			</td>
			<td> 
				<p>SYG holds general liability insurance that covers injuries only where negligence by SYG organisers can be demonstrated. Please note, this cover does not extend to any sporting injuries, as clearly outlined in our registration disclaimers.</p>
				<p>Any claims related to injury must be made through the participating Church’s own insurance policy. For this reason, it is a critical compliance requirement that all Churches involved in SYG have current and verified insurance coverage.</p>
				<p>If a Church does not have insurance in place, it is the responsibility of the Church or Group Coordinator to clearly inform participants that they must seek personal injury cover independently. Furthermore, if adequate insurance cover cannot be demonstrated, those individuals will unfortunately not be permitted to participate.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> 
				<strong>WWCC</strong>
			</td>
			<td> 
				All participants over 18 must have a WWCC, including visitors, teachers and police officers. If there is a reason they don't, we need to discuss. Please tick the box below requesting a follow-up call with SYG organisers
			</td>

			<td> 
				<strong>Financial Liability</strong>
			</td>

				<p>By accepting a participant to attend with your group on the registration system you are liable for their place. It is your group's responsibility to cover their cost if they pull out.</p>
				<p>Invoices are to be paid within 7 days of receipt.</p>
